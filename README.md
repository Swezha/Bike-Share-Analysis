**Bike Share Analysis**

**Project Overview**

Cyclistic, a fictional bike-share company in Chicago, aims to increase annual memberships by converting casual riders into members. This project analyzes historical ride data to identify differences in riding patterns and provide data-backed marketing recommendations.

**Objective**

- Understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently.
- Identify trends that influence casual riders to purchase memberships.
- Provide actionable marketing strategies based on data insights.
  
**Business Questions**
1. How do annual members and casual riders differ in bike usage?
2. What factors influence casual riders to become members?
3. How can digital media marketing help optimize Cyclistic’s strategy?

**Tools & Technologies Used**
R - Data cleaning, analysis, and visualization (ggplot2, dplyr, lubridate)
Tableau - Interactive visualizations for data storytelling

 **Data Analysis & Visualizations**
1. Usage Patterns: Members vs. Casual Riders
- Casual riders primarily use bikes on weekends, while members ride regularly on weekdays for commuting.
- Casual riders take longer trips, whereas members ride for shorter distances but more frequently.
2️. Peak Ride Times
- Members have consistent usage during morning & evening rush hours.
- Casual riders have varied ride patterns, often tied to leisure activities.
3️. Popular Bike Stations
